Light on the fingers and write the code to flow. Thought out the text and
abstract it, build on the understanding. Close source open source, motivated
to make new software. When you are in the depth it doesn't matter if 
well it does in terms of motivation, keep the model on why you end up in 
certain thought patterns. When you seen the most in different levels of 
abstractions. Keep the pattern and build upon it. Where it doen't make sense.
To write it out as is. Do you develop pain how you hold the keyboard and 
write it out. Possible to see when timestamp open folder and timestamp
close folder. That is the mesaure of Written time + thinking time to 
produce what you see infront of you. Push the envolope of creative process
with good syntax. 

In terms of writing better terms. How to describe the tf framework.

# Model
Create the model to create a relationship between the parameters. For the 
features and labels. Instead of condionally finding relationships, a good
machine learning algorithm establishes the model for you.

Any modern IDE. vim are what it is. Emacs binding known for being great

Not an IDE, not knowing what you are talking about.
What can the language. The tf model. 

# Keras
What is keras 
Tensorflow is a machine learning platform
Keras is the deep learning API running ontop of tensorflow, written in Python
